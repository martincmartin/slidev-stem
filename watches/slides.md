Before clocks, people told time by watching something flow.

[click] Sundials go back to about 1500 BCE, and a good one reads to within a few minutes. But no sun, no time. And even a perfect one can be off by up to 16 minutes from a steady clock, because the Sun itself doesn't keep steady time.

[click] Water clocks work at night, but they slow down as they drain, and they freeze in winter. The best managed about 15 minutes a day.

[click] Alfred the Great burned four-hour candles, until drafts made them burn out early. How accurate? I couldn't find anyone who measured it.

[click] Hourglass sand flows at a constant rate and doesn't mind a rolling ship. But someone has to flip a half-hour glass 48 times a day.

[click] Every one of these runs at a rate set by the outside world. A clock sets its own. Remember 15 minutes a day: the first mechanical clocks probably didn't beat it.

IF ASKED: Rome's first public sundial was war loot from Sicily; Pliny says Romans followed its wrong hours for 99 years (the latitude explanation is debated). Roman hours were 1/12 of daylight, about 45 min in winter to 75 in summer. Sailors shook the glass to end a watch early: "flogging the glass."
